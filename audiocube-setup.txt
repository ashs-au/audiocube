CUBE Notes:

OS setup for Pi/Raspbian

Aside from regular wifi OS config etc. Definitely want public key auth for ssh to get quick shell access onto each Pi

Startup config:

add these to /boot/config.txt:
# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audio=on
audio_pwm_mode=2
# don't start graphical env.
start_x=0

Note that the above is for (low quality) built-in Pi audio. Using the DAC board has some different directives

add these to /etc/rc.local for 
# persistent audio level:
amixer sset PCM,0 98%
# start the node audio player:
node /home/pi/cube-play/cube-play.js
# start the reset/reboot button listener script
